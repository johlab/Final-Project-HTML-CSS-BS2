Welcome to one of my first HTML and CSS Projects I completed in my Database Applications Class in 2023. I was very proud of this project at the time, and I still am.



Instructions:
When you start this website, begin from the home.html, then browse. The only functional recipe for this is the 'Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza'; the rest are placeholders. With that, you can browse anything you want. Thank You!


NOTE:
I will make edits to make it more functional and easier to navigate.
