Welcome to one of my first HTML and CSS Projects I completed in my Database Applications Class in 2023. At the time, I was very proud of this project and I still am to this day.



Instructions:
When you start this website, begin from the home.html then browse. The only functional recipe on this is the 'Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza', the rest are placeholders. With that you can browse all you want. Thank You!
